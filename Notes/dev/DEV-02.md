### Building our own Engine

## Parser

    First we give it a JS file and then it undergoes lexical analysis, 
    which breaks the code into tokens to identify their meaning.

## AST

    These tokens are formed into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
    this allows the engine to understand what's going on in the program and break things down one by one.
