## Is Javascript an interpreted Language?

    When javascript initially came out, yes it was an interpreted language.
    Initial engines such as Spider Monkey created by Brendan Eich that interpreted
    Javascript to bytecode.

    Andd that engine was able to run inside out browsers to tell our computers what to do.
    But things have evolved.

    Now we dont just have interpreters, we also use compilers to optimize the code.
    Thats the whole reason why Google built V8 so that it could be both an interpreter and a compiler
    So that they could process their Maps.
