## Why not just use machine code from the beginning?

    Compilation would have to be super fast on the browsers.
    Browsers would need to agree upon some binary executable format or standard that would understand machine code.
    
    But things are changing, we have web assembly.
    Where we can compiler code all the way down to Web assembly, this executable format so that it runs really fast
    instead of having to go through the whole javascript engine process.

    no more interpretor compiler and all the steps that JavaScript requires to actually run the code on the browser.
